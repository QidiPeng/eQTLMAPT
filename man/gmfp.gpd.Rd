\usage{
gmfp.gpd(snp.dat, fea.dat, conf, trios.idx, cl = NULL, nperm = 10000,
  gpd.perm = 0.01)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp.dat}{The eQTL genotype matrix. Each row is an eQTL, each column is
a sample.}

\item{fea.dat}{A feature profile matrix. Each row is for one feature, each
column is a sample.}

\item{conf}{A confounders matrix which is adjusted in mediation tests. Each
row is a confounder, each column is a sample.}

\item{trios.idx}{A matrix of selected trios indexes (row numbers) for
mediation tests. Each row consists of the index (i.e., row number) of the
eQTL in \code{snp.dat}, the index of cis-gene feature in \code{fea.dat},
and the index of trans-gene feature in \code{fea.dat}. The dimension is the
number of trios by three.}

\item{cl}{Parallel backend if it is set up. It is used for parallel
computing. We set \code{cl}=NULL as default.}

\item{nperm}{The number of permutations for testing mediation. If
\code{nperm}=0, only the nominal P-value is calculated. We set
\code{nperm}=10000 as default.}

\item{gpd.perm}{Decide when to use GPD to fit estimation parameters. When the
proportion of permutation better than the original statistic is greater
than par, the GPD is fitted to estimate the empirical P-value. We set
\code{gpd.perm}=0.01 as default.}
}
\value{
The algorithm will return a list of empirical.p, empirical.p.gpd,
  nominal.p, beta, std.error, t_stat, beta.total, beta.change.
  \item{empirical.p}{The mediation empirical P-values with nperm times
  permutation. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.}
  \item{empirical.p.gpd}{The mediation empirical P-values with nperm times
  permutation using GPD fit. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.}
  \item{nominal.p}{The mediation nominal P-values. A matrix with dimension of
  the number of trios.} \item{std.error}{The return std.error value of
  feature1 for fit liner models. A matrix with dimension of the number of
  trios.} \item{t_stat}{The return t_stat value of feature1 for fit liner
  models. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.} \item{beta}{The
  return beta value of feature2 for fit liner models in the case of feature1.
  A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.} \item{beta.total}{The
  return beta value of feature2 for fit liner models without considering
  feature1. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.}
  \item{beta.change}{The proportions mediated. A matrix with dimension of the
  number of trios.}

\description{
The gmfp.gpd function performs genomic mediation analysis with
  fixed permutation. It tests for mediation effects for a set of user
  specified mediation trios(e.g., eQTL, cis- and trans-genes) in the genome
  with the assumption of the presence of cis-association. When the empirical
  P-value is small enough, the GPD fit is used to estimate a more accurate
  empirical P value.

  It returns the mediation p-values(nominal P-value, empirical P-values
  obtained from ordinary calculations and empirical P-values estimated using
  GPD fitting), the coefficient of linear models(e.g, t_stat, std.error,
  beta, beta.total) and the proportions mediated(e.g., the percentage of
  reduction in trans-effects after accounting for cis-mediation).
}
\details{
The function performs genomic mediation analysis with fixed
  permutation. \code{Fixed Permutation scheme}{When calculating the empirical
  P-value, the data is permutated by a fixed number of times, and the
  statistics after permutation are separately calculated. Assuming that the
  number of permutation is N, where the number of permutation statistics that
  is better than the original statistic is M, then the Empirical P-value = (M
  + 1) / (N + 1).} \code{calculate Empirical P-values using GPD fitting}{The
  use of a fixed number of permutations to calculate empirical P-values has
  the disadvantage that the minimum empirical P-value that can be calculated
  is 1/N. This makes a larger number of permutations needed to calculate a
  smaller P-value. Therefore, we model the tail of the permutation value as a
  Generalized Pareto Distribution(GPD), enabling a smaller empirical P-value
  with fewer permutation times.}
