\usage{
gmfp.ac(snp.dat, fea.dat, known.conf, trios.idx, cl = NULL,
  cov.pool = NULL, pc.num = 30, nperm = 10000, fdr = 0.05,
  fdr_filter = 0.1)
}
\arguments{
\item{snp.dat}{The eQTL genotype matrix. Each row is an eQTL, each column is
a sample.}

\item{fea.dat}{A feature profile matrix. Each row is for one feature, each
column is a sample.}

\item{known.conf}{A confounders matrix which is adjusted in all mediation
tests. Each row is a confounder, each column is a sample.}

\item{trios.idx}{A matrix of selected trios indexes (row numbers) for
mediation tests. Each row consists of the index (i.e., row number) of the
eQTL in \code{snp.dat}, the index of cis-gene feature in \code{fea.dat},
and the index of trans-gene feature in \code{fea.dat}. The dimension is the
number of trios by three.}

\item{cl}{Parallel backend if it is set up. It is used for parallel
computing. We set \code{cl}=NULL as default.}

\item{cov.pool}{The pool of candidate confounding variables from which
potential confounders are adaptively selected to adjust for each trio. Each
row is a covariate, each column is a sample. We set \code{cov.pool}=NULL as
default, which will calculate PCs of features as cov.pool.}

\item{pc.num}{If \code{cov.pool}=NULL, use the previous num PCs as 
\code{cov.pool}.We set \code{pc.num}=30 as default.}

\item{nperm}{The number of permutations for testing mediation. If
\code{nperm}=0, only the nominal P-value is calculated. We set
\code{nperm}=10000 as default.}

\item{fdr}{The false discovery rate to select confounders. We set
\code{fdr}=0.05 as default.}

\item{fdr_filter}{The false discovery rate to filter common child and
intermediate variables. We set \code{fdr_filter}=0.1 as default.}

  std.error, t_stat, beta.total, beta.change. \item{empirical.p}{The
  mediation Empirical P-values with nperm times permutation. A matrix with
  dimension of the number of trios.} \item{nominal.p}{The mediation nominal
  P-values. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.}

  models. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.} \item{t_stat}{The
  return t_stat value of feature1 for fit liner models. A matrix with
  dimension of the number of trios.} \item{beta}{The return beta value of
  feature2 for fit liner models in the case of feature1. A matrix with
  dimension of the number of trios.} \item{beta.total}{The return beta value

  mediated. A matrix with dimension of the number of trios.}
  \item{pc.matrix}{PCs will be returned if the PCs based on expression data
  are used as the pool of potential confounders. Each column is a PC.}
  \item{sel.conf.ind}{An indicator matrix with dimension of the number of
  trios by the number of covariates in \code{cov.pool} or \code{pc.matrix}if
  the principal components (PCs) based on expression data are used as the
  pool of potential confounders.}

\description{
The gmfp.ac function performs genomic mediation analysis with
  fixed permutation and adaptive confounding adjustment. It tests for
  mediation effects for a set of user specified mediation trios(e.g., eQTL,
  cis- and trans-genes) in the genome with the assumption of the presence of
  cis-association. The gmfp.ac function considers either a user provided pool
  of potential confounding variables, real or constructed by other methods,
  or all the PCs based on the feautre data as the potential confounder pool.


  It returns the mediation p-values(nominal and empirical), the coefficient
  of linear models(e.g, t_stat, std.error, beta, beta.total), and the
  proportions mediated(e.g., the percentage of reduction in trans-effects
  after accounting for cis-mediation) based on the mediation tests i)
  adjusting for known confounders only, and ii) adjusting for known
  confounders and adaptively selected potential confounders for each
  mediation trio.
}
\details{
The funciton performs genomic mediation analysis with fixed
  permutation and adaptive confounding adjustment. \code{Fixed Permutation
  scheme}{When calculating the empirical P-value, the data is permutated by a
  fixed number of times, and the statistics after permutation are separately
  calculated. Assuming that the number of permutation is N, where the number
  of permutation statistics that is better than the original statistic is M,
  then the Empirical P-value = (M + 1) / (N + 1).} \code{Adaptive Confunding
  adjustment} {One challenge in mediation test in genomic studies is how to
  adjust unmeasured confounding variables for the cis- and trans-genes (i.e.,
  mediator-outcome) relationship.The current function adaptively selects the
  variables to adjust for each mediation trio given a large pool of
  constructed or real potential confounding variables. The function allows
  the input of variables known to be potential cis- and trans-genes
  (mediator-outcome) confounders in all mediation tests (\code{known.conf}),
  and the input of the pool of candidate confounders from which potential
  confounders for each mediation test will be adaptively selected
  (\code{cov.pool}). When no pool is provided (\code{cov.pool = NULL}), all
  the PCs based on feature profile (\code{fea.dat}) will be constructed as
  the potential confounder pool.}
